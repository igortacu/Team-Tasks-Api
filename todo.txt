so we need to solve this problem: managing tasks
for this, we are going to create a rest api.
our app should be able to manage tasks, this refers to: adding tasks, deleting, editing description or status, list the tasks.
inca devreme de auth si roluri, dar pe urma va fi


ok, lets define our data model, so we know what we need to work with

we need:
id, description, status(Todo, doing, done), title, priority(low, medium, high), deadline, createdAt, updatedAt

now lets discuss about the api contract or rules of communication

we have 2 key rules
1. path is a noun aka a resource
2. action is a http method ( get, post, patch, delete, etc.. )

1. create a task
POST /tasks

request payload:

{
  "title": "Finish lab report",
  "description": "Lab 4, update diagrams",
  "priority": "high",
  "deadline": "2026-01-10"
}

response(201) created:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Finish lab report",
  "description": "Lab 4, update diagrams",
  "status": "Todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "deadline": "2026-01-10",
  "createdAt": "2026-01-07T19:20:00",
  "updatedAt": "2026-01-07T19:20:00"
}

2. list tasks

GET /tasks

query parameters: status=todo, priority=high, q = report,

response: 200 OK
[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Finish lab report", "status": "TODO", "priority": "HIGH" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "Prepare slides", "status": "IN_PROGRESS", "priority": "MEDIUM" }
]


3. Get one task by Id
Get /tasks/{id}

response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Finish lab report",
  "description": "Lab 4, update diagrams",
  "status": "TODO",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "dueDate": "2026-01-10"
}


if not found then 404 not found:
{ "message": "Task not found" }


4. update a task
we can use either patch or put, but for now i think patch is ok, later we will use both of them

request a payload:
{ "status": "DONE" }


5. delete a task

DELETE /tasks/{id}

response: 204 (no content)

Allowed values
Status:
TODO
 - IN_PROGRESS
 - DONE

Priority:
 - LOW
 - MEDIUM
 - HIGH
